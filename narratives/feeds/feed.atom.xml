        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday a strange thing happened. You have probably seen it:
I&rsquo;m not going to concentrate on all the ways posting this was wrong. I expect there will be a shit storm strong enough without my five cents. In the spirit of this blog I&rsquo;m more interested in the questions relating to thinking and knowledge. And there&rsquo;s an obvious one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing is a tool. And as any good tool it can be used for many things. Sharing information. Telling stories. Messaging. Influencing people to make the choice you want them to make. All these uses were clear to me for a long time, and they all were pretty self-explanatory.
There was one special use though, that I was wondering about for a long time.
