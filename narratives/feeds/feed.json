I expect there will be a shit storm strong enough without my five cents. In the spirit of this blog I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in the questions relating to thinking and knowledge. And there\u0026rsquo;s an obvious one.\nHow do we know that we really know what we think we know?",

All these uses were clear to me for a long time, and they all were pretty self-explanatory.\nThere was one special use though, that I was wondering about for a long time.\nWriting helps you think. A couple of days ago I was flying from Lisbon to Krakow, first part of my journey to my home in Ukraine (why go there during the war is another story).",
