    <description><![CDATA[<p>With this post I&rsquo;m starting a new section on this blog about <strong>useful idiots</strong>.</p>
<p>I intend to write about celebrities, opinion leaders etc. that are used by Russian propaganda with them having no clue (differently from people who are obviously Russian assets). I plan to write a more detailed post on the history of the term &ldquo;useful idiot&rdquo; in the future.</p>
<p>So today we look at an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwQF70VMWS3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">instagram post</a>
 by renowned Danish director Lars von Trier:</p>

<p>Interesting point Mr. von Trier. So when Russians bomb our cities we shouldn&rsquo;t defend ourselves because we should care about Russian lives.</p>
<p>What about an extremely simple way of protecting Russian lives: getting out of Ukraine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the victim&rsquo;s fault that the attacker got injured while attacking. It&rsquo;s the victim&rsquo;s <em>achievement</em>.</p>
<p>So if you want to protect Russian lives then help us stop the war, not put your influence behind their aggression.</p>
