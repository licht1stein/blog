    <description><![CDATA[<p>There is a great book on propaganda. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/age-of-propaganda-anthony-pratkanis/1119469522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">The Age of Propaganda</a>
. It&rsquo;s a very worthy book that I sincerely recommend.</p>

<p>But when you hear the word propaganda, don&rsquo;t you think of it as of something from the past? You think of nazi Germany and those long speeches in black-and-white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that happens today. And in a way you are right.</p>
<p>That propaganda was small (only one country) and cozy (only one language). Yes, they tried to influence other countries, but it was a small effort. It was like selling hand-crafted products by mail order.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s thing is like AliExpress selling cheap industrial goods online.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-thing">The Real Thing</h2>
<p>The real age of propaganda is just starting. It&rsquo;s the only thing that Russia does well in the war against Ukraine. And it&rsquo;s something HAMAS is exceptionally good in the war against Israel (not without Russia&rsquo;s help, apparently).</p>
<p>Propaganda of the 20th century is kindergarten play compared to what we see today. Today&rsquo;s product is not hand crafted, it&rsquo;s mass-produced at fully automated AI factories operated by a few smart people. It&rsquo;s not small and cozy, it&rsquo;s huge and it&rsquo;s exported everywhere. Today&rsquo;s delivery of propaganda abroad is not mail-order of hand-crafted goods, it&rsquo;s Amazon and AliExpress scale logistics of millions of mass produced cheap products.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align: left">HAMAS actor as a fighter, injured, press, patient, mourning father</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The effect is devastating to human mind a spirit. The simple wrong answers were always easier to accept, but there were never so many to choose from. And <strong>nobody cares if the answers they are consuming are true</strong>.</p>
<p>In case of HAMAS it&rsquo;s especially easy to see. HAMAS is a terrorist organization, we all know that. It&rsquo;s basically controlling the entire Gaza region. <strong>Who in their right mind would ever expect to hear a single word of truth out of them?</strong></p>
<p>I mean you need motivation to say the truth instead of lying to everybody to your full advantage. In democracies you have free press, you have more or less independent prosecution systems, you have free speech where somebody might uncover something and make it public. This give at least some motivation to not lie.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align: left">Presumably independent reporter kissed by one of HAMAS leaders</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Obviously any dictatorship will use any truth it can in propaganda. Truth is more convincing when it plays along. But it&rsquo;s like with the famous saying that even a broken watch shows correct time twice a day.</p>
<p>The scary thing the people see the photos like the ones shown â€” with the same actor playing a distressed citizen, a fighter, a mourning father, and injured civilian, a doctor and a reporter. And people read stories that presumably independent reporters were magically present at the border when HAMAS breached it. And it changes nothing.</p>
<p>Emotionally they were already bought by propaganda. And no amount of truth will change their mindset. Because propaganda is not trying to convince, it&rsquo;s trying to create an emotion.</p>
<p>And once it succeeded&hellip; it&rsquo;s not afraid of truth any more.</p>
<p>HAMAS is openly saying <em>&ldquo;we used the money received as aid from developed nations to build underground tunnels and weapons. Protection of civilians is the task of UN&rdquo;</em>. And does it affect their popularity? No. Because the emotional link is already there &ldquo;Israelis are killing civilians&rdquo;.</p>

</figure>
<p>People are rallying on the streets because of the <em>&ldquo;humanitarian crisis unseen in the last 80 years&rdquo;</em> demanding cease-fire.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not true. It&rsquo;s not unseen. The scale of the humanitarian tragedy in Israel and Palestine is simply incomparable to what is happening in Ukraine. The death toll of the war Russia is waging against Ukraine is in the <em>hundred thousands</em>. Entire cities were erased from the face of the earth. There are more landmines than ever in human history anywhere. And it&rsquo;s much, much closer to Europe.</p>
<p>Yet we don&rsquo;t see such scale of protests on the streets. Why? Because Ukraine sucks at informational warfare and Russia is good at it. Russia has been pouring millions into propaganda everywhere and helping HAMAS along the way. Nobody cares about a full-scale war at their doorstep any more.</p>

  </iframe>
</div>
<p><strong>Humans can only worry about one thing at a time. So while they are worrying about Israel killing Palestinian children they are not worrying about Russia killing and kidnapping Ukrainian children on a much larger scale.</strong></p>
<p>It looks like democracies are just worse at propaganda than the dictatorships are, just like reasonable politicians are less popular than the extremist populists.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really bad news.</p>

    <title>On Small Propaganda Tricks</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-inspiration">The Inspiration</h2>
<p>I had a short <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@yogthos@lemmy.ml/110672976582947303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">discussion</a>
 on Mastodon today that started with this post:</p>

<p>Since this was a stone thrown at Ukraine I had to participate.</p>
<p>But this blog post and this blog is not about Ukraine but about thinking, so let&rsquo;s look at this at a slightly different angle, which does not require us to take sides in the immediate discussion about Ukraine, Canadian aid or land ownership, but rather explains a trick that is used by propagandists all over the world so much, that it&rsquo;s probably one of the oldest and most used in the book. It&rsquo;s also one of the most effective.</p>
<p>If you read the post again and ask yourself: what is this about? The answer is obvious: it&rsquo;s about the impact of some Canadian aid program on land privatization in Ukraine. Personally, I have no idea what aid program he&rsquo;s referring to. But that&rsquo;s not the point. And it&rsquo;s also not the point of this &ldquo;toot&rdquo; (as they call posts on Mastodon).</p>
<h2 id="the-distraction">The Distraction</h2>
<p>You see, the reference to the Canadian aid program is a distraction. As any illusionist would tell you, in order to pull off a trick you need to distract viewers attention to a place where nothing is actually happening, while you do your thing in another place altogether.</p>
<p>Frankly, most people don&rsquo;t care about the Canadian aid to Ukraine and even it&rsquo;s impact on Ukrainian land ownership. But even if they do, they&rsquo;ll either agree or disagree with it, and that would mean they got distracted.</p>
<h2 id="the-trick">The Trick</h2>
<p>The real trick that the author wants you to just not pay attention to, and therefore accept without critical evaluation, is in the word <em><strong>coup</strong></em>.</p>
<p>You see, we don&rsquo;t call a positive political event a coup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>coup</strong> a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics and especially the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Merriam-Webster</a>
)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sudden<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, decisive, violent overthrow by a small group of people<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Also violent, apparently. There is also the emotional attitude that the word carries. A coup is something planned behind closed doors and executed by violent people in palaces. It&rsquo;s something that happens in countries you wouldn&rsquo;t want to visit even in the best of days.</p>
<p>So while the poster distracts your attention by seemingly talking about Canandian aid, he is in fact smuggling a very emotionally charged and negative description to the events in Ukraine into your mind. With a single four-letter word. Not bad.</p>
<p>Now, you have the full right to agree or disagree with his description, but if you want to be thinking critically you need to <em>notice</em> it and ask yourself: wait a moment, do I actually agree that it was a coup and not a revolution, a peaceful protest, a democratic protest, an act of direct democracy by the people?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll need to do some reading, maybe you&rsquo;re just not interested. But if you noticed it - you didn&rsquo;t get tricked.</p>
<p>As I said before this trick is extremely effective and used a lot both in print and during speeches and debates. Now you know about it.</p>
<h2 id="update">UPDATE</h2>
<p>After I published this post and got some comments on it, I have managed to find an even better example of the same trick by the same poster.</p>

<p>This example is even better than the first one, so I had to update the post. Look what&rsquo;s going on here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a clear double standard between the media hysteria over alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine and the silence over the rampages by Israeli troops and settlers on the occupied West Bank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a moment yourself and try to point out, where is the distraction and where is the trick?</p>
<p>So the distraction is the whole part about media having double standards, and the trick, as always is in details. You see, while you&rsquo;re thinking about Israel and your position on what&rsquo;s going on there the poster is smuggling two very charged words: <strong>hysteria</strong> and <strong>alleged</strong>.</p>
<p>Neat, ha? If this wasn&rsquo;t propaganda I would almost admire the cunning and elegance. So the media reaction to the largest war since WW2 with literally thousands over thousands of documented war crimes is called &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo; and the crimes themselves are &ldquo;alleged&rdquo;, unproven, maybe non-existent.</p>
<p>As I said before, your opinion on the subject is your business. But for the sake of critical thinking you have to notice these words being smuggled while you&rsquo;re distracted.</p>
