<p>I had a short <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@yogthos@lemmy.ml/110672976582947303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">discussion</a>
 on Mastodon today that started with this post:</p>
<img src="/img/yogthos-toot.png" alt="@yogthos toot saying: Canadian ‘aid’ program set the table for post-Maidan coup land privatization drive">
<p>Since this was a stone thrown at Ukraine I had to participate.</p>
<p>But this blog post and this blog is not about Ukraine but about thinking, so let&rsquo;s look at this at a slightly different angle, which does not require us to take sides in the immediate discussion about Ukraine, Canadian aid or land ownership, but rather explains a trick that is used by propagandists all over the world so much, that it&rsquo;s probably one of the oldest and most used in the book. It&rsquo;s also one of the most effective.</p>
<p>If you read the post again and ask yourself: what is this about? The answer is obvious: it&rsquo;s about the impact of some Canadian aid program on land privatization in Ukraine. Personally, I have no idea what aid program he&rsquo;s referring to. But that&rsquo;s not the point. And it&rsquo;s also not the point of this &ldquo;toot&rdquo; (as they call posts on Mastodon).</p>
<h2 id="the-distraction">The Distraction</h2>
<p>You see, the reference to the Canadian aid program is a distraction. As any illusionist would tell you, in order to pull off a trick you need to distract viewers attention to a place where nothing is actually happening, while you do your thing in another place altogether.</p>
<p>Frankly, most people don&rsquo;t care about the Canadian aid to Ukraine and even it&rsquo;s impact on Ukrainian land ownership. But even if they do, they&rsquo;ll either agree or disagree with it, and that would mean they got distracted.</p>
<h2 id="the-trick">The Trick</h2>
<p>The real trick that the author wants you to just not pay attention to, and therefore accept without critical evaluation, is in the word <em><strong>coup</strong></em>.</p>
<p>You see, we don&rsquo;t call a positive political event a coup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>coup</strong> a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics and especially the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Merriam-Webster</a>
)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sudden<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, decisive, violent overthrow by a small group of people<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Also violent, apparently. There is also the emotional attitude that the word carries. A coup is something planned behind closed doors and executed by violent people in palaces. It&rsquo;s something that happens in countries you wouldn&rsquo;t want to visit even in the best of days.</p>
<p>So while the poster distracts your attention by seemingly talking about Canandian aid, he is in fact smuggling a very emotionally charged and negative description to the events in Ukraine into your mind. With a single four-letter word. Not bad.</p>
<p>Now, you have the full right to agree or disagree with his description, but if you want to be thinking critically you need to <em>notice</em> it and ask yourself: wait a moment, do I actually agree that it was a coup and not a revolution, a peaceful protest, a democratic protest, an act of direct democracy by the people?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll need to do some reading, maybe you&rsquo;re just not interested. But if you noticed it - you didn&rsquo;t get tricked.</p>
<p>As I said before this trick is extremely effective and used a lot both in print and during speeches and debates. Now you know about it.</p>
<h2 id="update">UPDATE</h2>
<p>After I published this post and got some comments on it, I have managed to find an even better example of the same trick by the same poster.</p>
<img src="/img/alleged.png" alt="lemmy post by @yogthos US media covers up Israeli war crimes in Jenin">
<p>This example is even better than the first one, so I had to update the post. Look what&rsquo;s going on here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a clear double standard between the media hysteria over alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine and the silence over the rampages by Israeli troops and settlers on the occupied West Bank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a moment yourself and try to point out, where is the distraction and where is the trick?</p>
<p>So the distraction is the whole part about media having double standards, and the trick, as always is in details. You see, while you&rsquo;re thinking about Israel and your position on what&rsquo;s going on there the poster is smuggling two very charged words: <strong>hysteria</strong> and <strong>alleged</strong>.</p>
<p>Neat, ha? If this wasn&rsquo;t propaganda I would almost admire the cunning and elegance. So the media reaction to the largest war since WW2 with literally thousands over thousands of documented war crimes is called &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo; and the crimes themselves are &ldquo;alleged&rdquo;, unproven, maybe non-existent.</p>
<p>As I said before, your opinion on the subject is your business. But for the sake of critical thinking you have to notice these words being smuggled while you&rsquo;re distracted.</p>
