Influencing people to make the choice you want them to make. All these uses were clear to me for a long time, and they all were pretty self-explanatory.\nThere was one special use though, that I was wondering about for a long time.\nWriting helps you think. A couple of days ago I was flying from Lisbon to Krakow, first part of my journey to my home in Ukraine (why go there during the war is another story).\nRight before the take off I stumbled upon an essay by Paul Graham called, ironically, The Age of the Essay. As brilliant people often do, he put in words precisely the things I felt for a long time.\nI recommend you read his original piece, as he did a great job about describing the history and the essence of writing essays. But I will quote one thing:\nIn a real essay you\u0026rsquo;re writing for yourself. You\u0026rsquo;re thinking out loud.\nBut not quite. Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.\nAnd this really stroke a note inside. I knew for a long time that writing helps me think. I even joked sometimes that you need to sit down and write on the subject to find out what your real opinion is.\nBut reading Graham\u0026rsquo;s piece changed two things:\nThis kind of writing now had a name. Essays. It gave me a good reason to publish what I write. And now you\u0026rsquo;re here. Reading.\nThank you for giving me a reason to clean up my mess!\n","date":1348099200,"href":"https://licht1stein.github.io/blog/narratives/why-write-2022-09-20/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1348099200,"objectID":"a7e4780b7c7856754d4786f4015ed11b","publishDate":"2012-09-20T00:00:00Z","section":"narratives","tags":[],"title":"Why write?","type":"narratives"}]
