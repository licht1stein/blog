When the war started many people left Ukraine. In fact it was largest movement of people in the modern history, with 12 millions crossing the border since Russia tried to invade us on February 24.

Five million seem to have came back, which leaves seven million Ukrainians still out there. I'm one of them.

The notorious Russian soul perhaps. But let's see if this story even has a right to exists.

## So, you cannot beat Russia, can you?
So, is there something so special about the Russians and their army that makes them unbeatable? Let's do some basic research:
