When the war started many people left Ukraine. In fact it was largest movement of people in the modern history, with 12 millions crossing the border since Russia tried to invade us on February 24.

Five million seem to have came back, which leaves seven million Ukrainians still out there. I'm one of them.

It so happened that I can easily start a conversation with a stranger. I know that people often struggle with this, but I guess I was lucky — I could do this ever since I was a little kid. And I've had a lot of conversations since leaving Ukraine. Predictably, many of them were about the war.

It's obvious that it's very hard to tell what's going on if you live in Portugal, Spain, France... heck, even in Poland. Despite their best efforts people are still affected by the things they hear on TV (and I mean TV in a broadest possible sense, even if they read it online). One thing stroke me as very interesting — I hear the same questions or statements from people in different countries. Over and over.

So I thought why not try thinking about them. So here goes. Let's start with the one that I find the most curios.

# What is Ukraine defending?
You can have this in different flavors, like "you cannot reach peace by providing more weapons" or "Ukraine should do a better job negotiating peace" etc. This raises an interesting and obvious question: when you blame Ukraine for prolonging the war by *defending*, why don't you blame Russia for prolonging it by attacking?
