# What is thinking?

People will easily admit they can't do things they never trained for. Playing a violin. Driving a motorbike. Speaking an exotic language. All these things are much easier, than learning to think critically and for yourself. But you'll be lucky to meet a person who would admit they're not particularly good at it.

Well, you met one now. I don't think as good at thinking as one needs to be to survive the modern world. 

Hopefully writing will help me improve.
